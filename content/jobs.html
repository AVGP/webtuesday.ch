<p>We recommend the following job platforms...</p>

<h2>freshjobs.ch</h2>

<p><a href="http://freshjobs.ch">freshjobs.ch</a> is a platform for listing Internet-specific jobs e.g. webdesigner, Frontend Engineer, PHP developer etc. Employers pay a small fee to list jobs and potential candidates get to browse for free.</p>

<h2>skillbill.ch</h2>

<p><a href="http://skillbill.ch/">skillbill.ch</a> is not your typical job platform. Instead candidates can present themselves <em>anonymously</em>, based on their skillset, for potential employers to discover them based on their needs.</p>
