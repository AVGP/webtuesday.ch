<h2>Agenda</h2>

<p>Load Testing of Web Applications by  JÃ¼rg Stuker</p>
<p>Content are some basic thoughts, principles and tipps followed by a demonstration of black box testing with some real numkbers. I use quite different tools (including stupid but useful <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">Apache ab</a>). For the session I will show the <a href="http://www.proxy-sniffer.com/freeEdition.html">free Proxy-Sniffer by David Fischer</a>. I like the versatility of the tool very much and there is a simple documentation to get up and running very quickly. 'Nough said?</p>
