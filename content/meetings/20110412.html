<p>We meet at 19:30 at the <em>new</em> Memonic office at <a href="http://map.local.ch/en/Badenerstrasse-120-8004-Zuerich-District">Badenerstrasse 120, ZÃ¼rich</a> (this is <strong>not</strong> the Liip office!).</p>

<h2>Distributed Version Control with Mercurial</h2>
<p>
    Distributed version control tools like Mercurial are faster and more flexible than the traditional tools like CVS and SVN. Mercurial is used by projects ranging in size from a single developer up to very large projects such as Firefox and OpenOffice.
</p>
<p>
    The talk will have two parts: Martin Geisler ( #mgsys ) from aragost Trifork will start by giving you an introduction to Mercurial and distributed version control.
</p>

<p>
    Afterwards, Cedric Staub from Wyona will present a case study of how switching from Subversion to Mercurial allowed for greater flexibility in their development process.
