<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p><strong>Improving navigation in tag spaces (folksonomies)</strong> by Philipp Keller</p>
<p>Tags have been around for about 2 years now but there is still not much done in order for a better navigation within tagged items. I will present a few ideas and algorithms to give means to improve that situation. The talk will be based on a talk I gave at www2006.</p>
