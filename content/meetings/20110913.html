<h2>Agenda</h2>

</p>

<h3>MongoDB: lessons learned at Doodle</h3>
<p>
    There has been a lot of “noise” about so-called NoSQL databases in recent times. And with all the promises made by the different database    vendors, <a href="http://doodle.com/">Doodle</a> could not resist the temptation either. 
    Doodle now uses <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, an open source, high-performance, schema-free, document-oriented database.
</p>
<p>    
    <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mschiebelmann">Malte Schiebelmann</a>, Software Engineer at Doodle, will talk about MongoDB and the NoSQL lessons learned at Doodle.
</p>

<h3>Swiss Open Source Awards</h3>
<p>
    The <a href="http://www.ossawards.ch/">Swiss Open Source Awards</a> are quickly becoming an institution in our industry, bringing our -often  hidden- champions into the limelight. At the 2011 award ceremony, right after the Webtuesday talk, there's going to be high-speed presentations by the nominees, just three minutes each, followed by the verdict of the honorable hacker <a href="http://www.ossawards.ch/jury/">jury</a> in the categories "Community", "Business" and "Youth".  
</p>
<p>  
    Before the show there'll be an aperitif, afterwards some <a href="http://www.freebeer.ch/">FreeBeer</a> will have to be taken care of.
</p>
