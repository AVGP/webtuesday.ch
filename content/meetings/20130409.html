<ul>
    <li>Mobile web applications are written by people who are afraid of learning a real programming language.</li>
    <li>Native apps are a walled garden with lots of lock-in.</li>
    <li>Mobile web applications are slow, ugly and buggy.</li>
    <li>Native apps provide inconsistent interfaces across platforms.</li>
</ul>
