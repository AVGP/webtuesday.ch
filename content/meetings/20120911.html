<h2>Sign up</h2>
Over on <a href="http://techup.ch/702">techup</a> - thanks!

<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>
    We'll have the amazing guys of <a href="http://evrythng.net/">EVRYTHNG</a>, Vlad Trifa and Dominique Guinard. They're building a real-time "Facebook of Things", following up on the vision of a <a href="http://webofthings.org">Web of Things</a> in which embedded devices become first-class citizens of the Web - and every day objects such as cars, bikes, TVs, mobile phones or plants can talk to each other using HTTP.
<p/>
<p>
    The two engineers will show us how to easily web-enabled various sensors and actuators as well as NFC, EPC and QR tags and how to bootstrap the access to their virtual profiles on the EVRYTHNG engine.
<p>
    Their slogan: your objects will soon have a Facebook profile, make sure you tag them before they'll tag you!
