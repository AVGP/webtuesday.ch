<h2>Agenda</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Topic: XHProf - facebooks PHP profiler</li>
    <li>Speaker: Harry Fuecks</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://mirror.facebook.net/facebook/xhprof/">XHProf</a>, the PHP profiler written by facebook to allow performance analysis of live web applications. You may have used <a href="http://xdebug.org/">xdebug</a> already and one thing I'll be discussing is why you want both. We've been using XHProf at local.ch since February 2010 so there's one or two "war stories" to be told as well. Hopefully an interesting talk for PHP geeks or those having to deal with higher traffic web sites.</p>
