<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>"<strong>Finding Order in Execution</strong>" by Lukas Smith
<p>That 5 table join is taking 30 seconds and you do not know why? EXPLAIN is the tool of choice to getting to the bottom if your performance issues. As part of this talk we will go through the necessary jargon, algorithms and tricks to optimize SQL queries. Particular focus will be put on finding the optimal execution plan order and how to get the database to follow this optimal order. The information provided will be useful to users of any database, but MySQL and PostgreSQL will be used as examples.</p>
