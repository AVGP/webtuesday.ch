<h2>Agenda</h2>

<h3>Scaling Web Apps With RabbitMQ</h3>
<p><a href="http://videlalvaro.github.com/">Alvaro Videla</a> will discuss messaging scenarios that can help scale our web applications - from using <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> as a simple "queue server" for running background CPU intensive tasks to implementing RPC over AMQP.</p>
<p>We'll see how message multicast can help to simplify the logic of web apps to make it scalable and fault tolerant. We'll see how to implement load balancing with RabbitMQ and how real time logging and monitoring has never been easier.</p>

<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>Alvaro is a Web Developer working for <a href="http://www.liip.ch/">Liip AG</a>. He's also co-authoring the book <a href="http://manning.com/videla/">RabbitMQ in Action</a> for Manning Publications.</p>
