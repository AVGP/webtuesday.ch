<h3>Next generation data storage with CouchDb</h3>
<p>by Jan Lehnardt</p>
<p>As always, the digital world is evolving. Quickly. Yet, the way we store our data was envisioned decades(!) ago. To accommodate today's needs, wild solutions are tacked onto old systems. This practice is commonly known as hacking. While these solutions work great for a number of people, they share a fundamental flaw: They are hacks who pervert the original idea of the system's design and implementation.</p>
<p>CouchDb is designed to fulfil data storage requirements in modern times. It doesn't come with legacy to support and without hacks to make it work on current and future systems. If you are looking for ways to save, see, secure and share your data as in The four pillars of data management, CouchDb supports all of them:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Save - Robust, ACID compliant storage engine.</li>
    <li>See - View engine to efficiently filter, format and organize data.</li>
    <li>Share - Efficient, incremental, bi-directional replication.</li>
    <li>Secure - Distributed security and validation model.</li>
    <li>How many S'es does your database support?</li>
</ul>
<p>CouchDb directly supports distributed multi-machine setups with multiple-core CPUs. Out of the box. I'll show you the box and how to open it.</p>
