<h2>Agenda</h2>

<p>"Simple Services" by Tristan</p>
<p>30 minutes intro on the Simple Services philosophy. Introduced a bit over a year ago at local.ch, it's time we share some experiences.</p>
<p>It's going to be a short talk, in order to leave room for some lightning talks.</p>
<p>Come see me if you want to talk, usual rules apply (max. 8 min / talk, max. 4 slides, setup and Q&amp;A included)... relaxed as usual...</p>
