<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>Markus Leutwyler will talk about:</p>
<p>You know webOS</p>
<p>We've seen the rise of web apps, written in HTML/CSS/Javascript, running on top of WebKit. Palm's webOS treats web apps as first citizens, even the built-in apps are built that way. We'll take a closer look at what webOS is and how to develop web apps for it. If you are a web developer, you'll feel right at home with webOS.</p>
