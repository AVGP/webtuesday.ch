<h2>Presentation</h2>

<h2>Agenda</h2>

<p>Following on from the <a href="/meetings/20080708/">successes of last month</a>, it's time for another round of Lighting Talks.</p>

<h3>How they work</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Short talks on a topic that's interesting but not enough to talk 45 minutes about e.g. "here is an nice debugging trick I use" or "this is a tool I've been evaluating recently" or "did you didn't know you could do X in Javascript"</li>
    <li>There is a time limit - 8 minutes max, including hooking up your laptop at the start and questions after.</li>
    <li>If you need slides, less is more plus keep them in portable form (if connecting to the beamer is a problem)</li>
    <li>You can turn up with a talk on the evening - no need to announce up front (although you can if you want to below)</li>
</ul>

<h3> Talk Discovery... </h3>
