<p>This month we won&#8217;t have one but three talks at the webtuesday!
Local.ch organised recently an internal engeneering conferece.
We will get to hear three of the most web-related talks condensed in 3 x 20mins.</p>

<h2 id="1_docker_presented_by_eduard_schli">1. Docker presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/eduardschaeli">Eduard Sch√§li</a></h2>

<p>A brief intro and live demonstration using Docker to set up a Linux container instance, with support for Ruby on Rails hosting.</p>

<h2 id="2_locomotive_cms_presented_by_thomas_preusse">2. Locomotive CMS presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/tpreusse">Thomas Preusse</a></h2>

<p>Thomas will then describe Locomotive CMS, it&#8217;s strengths/weaknesses and explain how local.ch uses it. He will do a live demo in which he sets up Locomotive (using the Docker container that Edi set up in the previous talk for deployment). He will then quickly build a JSON API using the web interface.</p>

<h2 id="3_angularjs_presented_by_jonas_wagner">3. Angular.js presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/29a_ch">Jonas Wagner</a></h2>

<p>Jonas will then do a live demo in which he bootstraps an Angular.js app, connects to the CMS JSON API that was created by Thomas, and makes a simple working HTML5 app to browse and search the data from the CMS.</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>The meeting starts at <strong>19:00</strong> at the <a href="http://mila.com">Mila</a> office: <a href="https://maps.google.ch/maps?q=Seestrasse+356+8038+Zurich++Switzerland">Seestrasse 356, 8038 Zurich</a>.</p>
