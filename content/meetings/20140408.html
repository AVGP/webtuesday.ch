<h2>HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) for PHP</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hhvm.com/">HHVM</a> is a new open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in PHP. 
It is developed by Facebook and is much faster than a webserver with stock PHP. It also adds some 
new language features like type checking, generics, async operations and collections called <a href="http://hacklang.org">Hack</a> </p>
<p>This talk will go into the details of HHVM, show some examples of Hack and also tell about 
real life experience with it.</p>
