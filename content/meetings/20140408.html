<h2>HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM) for PHP</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hhvm.com/">HHVM</a> is a new open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in PHP. 
It is developed by Facebook and is much faster than a webserver with stock PHP. It also adds some

real life experience with it.</p>
