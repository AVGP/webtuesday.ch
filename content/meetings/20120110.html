<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>
	<a href="http://swisstrains.ch">Swisstrains.ch</a> is a simulation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Railways">Swiss Federal Railways</a> network. The simulation is based on the SBB timetables and railroad vector data (track lines and stations) of Switzerland. The project remained frozen for almost 4 years but recently a <a href="http://simcity.vasile.ch/sbb/">new version</a> kicked off with faster, better UX and enriched features.
</p> 
<p>
	The figures behind the project are quite impressive: the railroad network has more than 5,000 km in length, inside which run daily ca. 13,000 trains that generate 150,000 timetables stops across 1,800 stations. An open source <a href="https://github.com/vasile/vehicle-simulator">vehicle simulator</a> powers the new version, of which you'll get a short demo, will see how to use it in and how to to create your own public transport simulation. You'll hear all about the deeper motivation behind the project, the challenges encountered, the technology stack used and where it all goes next.
