abstract: Joiz - Redefining Television
---

<p>We meet at 19:30 at the offices of UPC Cablecom, <a href="http://map.local.ch/search/Zollstrasse%2042%20Z%C3%BCrich">Zollstrasse 42</a>.</p>

<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>ZÃ¼rich-based <a href="http://joiz.tv">Joiz</a> is an ambitious and courageous attempt at redefining television, making it an inherently social medium. They've been building an entirely new concept of what TV could be, aiming at all screens from your mobile to the big screen in your living room, providing an experience integrated with the web and with platforms from Skype to Facebook. The technology enabling such an experience must not only be highly flexible (this being an experiment after all) but also scalable (this is mass media) and deal with the realtime nature of the medium (live participatory TV).<br />
Joiz is offering Webtuesday a unique peek behind the curtain, presenting the vision and architecture as well as stories from the trenches in building the platform with a state-of-the-art toolbox containing <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony2</a>, <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a>, <a href="http://www.wowza.com/">Wowza</a>, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> - and quite some more. We'll be hearing about the challenges they met, the lessons they learned and the goals they'll be targeting next.
