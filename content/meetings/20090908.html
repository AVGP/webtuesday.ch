<p>
    <strong>«Three Open Source Frameworks for Functional Tests: Fit/FitNesse, Concordion & Cucumber»</strong>
    by Markus Gaelli.
</p>

<p>There are three main types of automated testing:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>Unit tests</em> focus on technical details and are usually defined by developers.</li>
    <li><em>Functional tests</em> (also known as <em>acceptance tests</em>) focus on business value and are defined by the customer.</li>
    <li><em>GUI tests</em> focus both on user interface and business value but usually need a GUI on which capture/replay tools can be executed on. Thus they come late in the game and are usually quite brittle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Customers in agile projects need to define when they consider a user story to be done. Developers need to know <em>at the beginning</em> of an iteration under when they can ship the story as done. As a consequence customers need to define the test criteria for the automatic tests of a story <em>before</em> there is a GUI on which to capture automatic GUI tests.</p>
<p>Only functional testing can help here, as unit tests are too technical and GUI tests are too late and also too brittle. Based on his industrial experience, our member [[members:markus.gaelli]] will introduce and compare three prominent open source functional testing frameworks <a href="http://fitnesse.org">Fit/FitNesse</a>, <a href="http://www.concordion.org">Concordion</a> and <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>.</p>
