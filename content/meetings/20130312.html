<!-- TODO: When you set up this event.

1. Create a Techup event once the topic is known. The location can still be
   unassigned for that.
2. Add topic to this page, use a previous month for template.
3. Fill out the abstract so it shows up nicely in the events list.
4. Once the location is defined put it in here.
5. Send out a newsletter notification and Twitter alerts one week before the
   event.
6. Again send out Twitter alerts one day before the event.

<p>We meet at 19:30. The location hasn't been assigned yet.</p>

<h2>Agenda</h2>
<p>
    <a href="http://nelm.io/pierre">Pierre Spring</a> will talk about
    responsive design done responsibly. He has real-life experience with the
    topic from various projects. So in his signature style he will spare us the
    marketing nonsense and talk about real problems and solutions.
