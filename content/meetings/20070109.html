<h2>Agenda</h2>

<p>How many passwords can you remember? Sick of creating accounts on every new Web 2.0 site? What Microsoft tried with Passport a few years ago has been reinvented in a distributed fashion and in a way everybody can use it - open source. It's called <strong>OpenID</strong>.</p>
<p>The presentation will start with the basics of distributed web authentication and should end in a discussion about how web site provides (there should be some in the audience ;-) could team up to unify and mesh-up their users.</p>
<p>Learn more by viewing this screen-cast or technical details at <a href="http://openid.net/">openid.net</a></p>
<p>Target audience: If you are interested in Identity Management, Distributed Authentication, Privacy and what it's also called Identity 2.0.</p>
