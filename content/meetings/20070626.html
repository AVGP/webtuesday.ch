<h3>webtuesday special</h3>

<strong>"Scaling with Amazon Web Services / powertools on a micro-budget"</strong>
<p>...including Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) beta by Tristan</p>
<p>Note: Amazon's EC2 will probably be out of BETA by the end of the summer, after which we'll probably get tired of hearing about it. Getting ahead of the game, this webtuesday "special" injects a second meeting into the month for the sake of the scoop - first hand experiences from Tristan.</p>
