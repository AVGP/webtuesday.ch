<h2>Topic</h2>
<h3>Ein Einblick in <a href="http://blick.ch/">Blick</a> - Making News with PHP</h3>

<p>presented by <a href="http://ning.ch/">Benjamin Rüegg</a>, in German.</p>

<p>Benjamin works at <a href="http://blick.ch/">Blick</a>, and he's a hybrid: a developer, a journalist, an art director if necessary - a "news developer" in every sense of the word. Many talk about reinventing news, about data-driven journalism and so, but here's someone right from Ringier's central newsroom, pushing the envelope, with real-time data analysis in PHP</p>

<p>Working in the newsroom with everybody else writing the news we all read, Benjamin is building technology that makes a difference: his LiveMonitor provides real-time performance analysis of all online articles, his APIs and crawlers pull together news from agencies, readership and radio, creates live heatmaps and helps to understand news. 300 people use it daily to create news, generating over 50 million visits per months.</p>

<p>Benjamin will show us the technology he uses, the tool he created, and tell us how he's doing it all without meetings and management. For once we're not talking about fancy technologies nobody uses yet, but about how to apply open source tools to get things done in a high-speed, large-scale environment with high stakes.</p>
